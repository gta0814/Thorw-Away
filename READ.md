# Throw Away

> Notes by Weite Geng

The line above is equivalent to an `<h1>Throw Away<h1>` HTML: markup.

The idea of Markdown files is to make it easier to write text that you want to have *some* sort of **richness* to it, but don't want to get hung up on the details of markup (HTML) or having to resort to more "binary" representation such as in MS Word.

Markdown can produce lists, just like this:

- A List Item can start with either a dash or an asterix.
	- It's a good idea to be consistent
	- This line, and the one above are "indented" in the lists
- Unordered lists are easy to do in Markdown.
- Besides unordered lists, you can do "ordered" lists. For an ordered list, use the number 1 followed by a dot (as seen below.)

## Other Examples

The line above is equivalent to an `<h2>` element. (Note the two pound symbols - you can have up to six!)

For your homework:

	1. Code snuppets (like `<h1>Code</h1>`)
	1. Code blocks (multiple lines of code)
	1. **Bold** and *Italic*
	1. Tables
	1. Hyperlinks (e.g.: [Google Home Page] (www.google.ca))
	1. Images
	1. Other interesting things
1. Answer the question, "What is the difference between *GitHub Flavored Markdown** (GFM) and regular markdown?"
1. Find out how to do a checkbox in a list item using GFM.
